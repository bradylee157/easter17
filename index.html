      <h2>Maundy Thursday</h2>
      <p><strong>Thursday, April 13</strong></p>
      <p>This service commemorates the night that Jesus celebrated the Last Supper with his disciples. &ldquo;Maundy&rdquo; is a word derived from the French word, mand&eacute;, derived from the Latin word, <em>mandatum</em>, meaning &lsquo;command&rsquo;.</p>
      <p>That night Jesus said to his disciples, <em>Mandatum novum do vobis</em>&mdash;&ldquo;A new commandment I give unto you&rdquo; (John 13:34). This evening we remember Christ&rsquo;s institution of Communion, his command to his disciples, &ldquo;Love one another as I have loved you,&rdquo; and his example of servanthood when he washed his disciples&rsquo; feet.</p>
      <p>Sanctuary @ 7:30 p.m.</p>
      



      <h2>Tenebrae</h2>
      <p><strong>Friday, April 14</strong></p>
      <p>The Tenebrae service is the remembrance of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross. It is not a memorial service; rather, we remember the extent to which God went to love us, and we reflect with repentance upon the sin that require such an act.</p>
      <p>Tenebrae literally means &lsquo;darkness&rsquo;. Candles are gradually diminished as Christ&rsquo;s death becomes more and more imminent. We use 12 candles to symbolize the abandonment of Christ&rsquo;s disciples. The service ends when, in darkness, we hear the <em>strepitus</em>, the sound of the closing of the tomb. After a moment of silence, the congregation exits in quiet darkness.</p>
      <p>Sanctuary @ 8 p.m.</p>
